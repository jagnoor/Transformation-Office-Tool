# Transformation Office Block & Gantt Creator Tool

A local, non-technical-friendly Streamlit app that turns a simple Excel workbook into an executive-ready roadmap chart (blocked diagram / swimlane Gantt) with clean overlap stacking, a smart timeline header, and one-click exports to:

- Print-ready PDF (vector)
- High-resolution PNG (DPI selectable)
- Editable PowerPoint (PPTX) with shapes you can move, resize, and edit

The visual style is designed for transformation office and executive roadmap communication, inspired by common “blocked diagram” decks used in leadership updates.

## Why this exists

Executives want to understand:
- What work is happening
- When it happens
- What’s running in parallel
- Where risk exists

This tool makes that obvious—fast—using a consistent, readable visual that is resilient to messy input.

## Key features

- Excel-first workflow (download template → fill → upload)
- Optional in-app editing (Workstreams + Tasks in editable grids)
- Hard rep
